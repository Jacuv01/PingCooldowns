# PingCooldowns

PingCooldowns is a World of Warcraft addon that allows players use the Cooldown Manager to quickly share the cooldown status of their abilities with their group or raid. With a simple click, you can broadcast whether a spell is ready or on cooldown, making group coordination easier and more efficient.

- **Talent & Spell Override Detection:** Automatically detects talent-based spell overrides to ensure accurate cooldown reporting
- **Intelligent Chat Routing:**
